College was always a paradox to high-school me. It was an extremely difficult period of time where students reach all-time lows, feel depressed and hopeless with grades, relationships, loans, and even contemplate suicide or other forms of personal harm to escape the cycle. At the same, it was the home of individual growth and self-betterment: you learned to cope with stress, realized what you wanted out of life, and created lasting bonds that would motivate you to move forward. Even before applying, I feared that I wouldn't make the most of my college experience: I wanted to grow emotionally, physically, mentally, spiritually, and every other word with a "ly" suffix you could think of. To this day, I still fear that same notion, but to a lesser extent. My first semester here at Berkeley changed the way I view myself and the world around me, and I look forward to the upcoming semesters. Here are a few of my highlights.

I had made extremely amazing friends over the years spent in my hometown, Petaluma. We had our collection of fights and our relationships have been strained in the past, but now I'm grateful that they were with me this entire time. They reaffirmed my faith, encouraged me in my darkest times, and laughed with me from the beginning of second grade to high school graduation and beyond. I feel indebted to them, and so my biggest fear entering Berkeley was friends. Not just any friends, but ones that agreed with my morals and were compatible with me. I don't believe myself to be discriminatory in my friendships, but there are some morals or values I see in others before considering them close at all. As such, the first few days consisted of flat, superficial relationships at the local dining hall. I made casual talk, albeit quietly, yet I felt like no one was really interested in the conversation at hand. I wasn't either, but I was desperately searching for an outlet, someone or something to displace the anxiety I had over making friends,

Thankfully, this fear was displaced within a week after meeting my amazing roommates and suitemates. Our initial meet-up at a Super Smash Bros. match evolved into political debates, harmless pranks to the RA, and late-night programming for projects due in the next five minutes. I am extremely thankful for meeting them all, no matter how brutally sarcastic or hilariously awkward our situations can be. Here, I felt at home. Here, I felt ready to tackle the challenges at UC Berkeley.

The semester progressed with a few imbalances: I was struggling with Linear Algebra, concerned over the Computer Science major GPA cap (3.3+ GPA in 3 core courses to declare), and, as previously mentioned, worried that I wouldn't be making the most of my college experience. However, I made a lot of great advances that I look back on with pride. I sat in on the Discrete Mathematics and Probability lectures for half a semester, attended two hackathons and created amazing gadgets, and got back into my weight-lifting and running cycle. My courses were difficult but fascinating, and I honestly felt at home for the first semester. Yet, there was one concern that echoed in the back of my mind.

I remember hearing the following from every college orientation / visit day: "You breezed through high school, but college was different. It will push you to your limits and you will work harder than you ever have before." Even at Berkeley, even from my colleagues, I heard so many discuss how I will never work as hard as I have before. This was a shock to me, because I worked extremely hard throughout high school. I honestly believe I was (and perhaps am) of average intelligence, and the only reason I ended up at Berkeley was due to the sheer effort I put into everything I did: extracurriculars, volunteer work, grades, and tests to name a few. I spent a year drafting and drafting my college essay, showing every teacher, peer, and parent multiple copies before submitting. I felt like I pushed myself to my own limits and just managed to get into Berkeley. If I worked so hard to end up here, with amazing students who've seldom put in effort in high school, am I really ready for the four years here? It's been said that hard work overcomes natural talent, but I still had my doubts.

I haven't come to terms with the problem, and I don't know when (if?) I'll find a solution. I've decided to take it easy, however, and not worry about it. I've chosen not to worry myself with problems like these: it's out of my control. I'll just continue doing what I've always done and make adjustments as the situation changes.

It's just like Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop) said: "Whatever happens, happens."
