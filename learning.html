										<h2> <center> Online Learning is Painfully Rewarding </center> </h2>
										<center> <img src="images/edX.png"> </center>
										<p> Just recently, I told my dad to enroll in a course on edX (Introduction to Philosophy, taught by MIT through the amazing learning platform <a href="http://www.edx.org"> edX </a>). 

										He began watching the lectures every other night, but I only imagined he’d last a few days before he’d say “Screw it” and drop it like it was hot.

										<br> <br>


										To my shock, he began to spend every night reading and rereading course notes, rewatching lectures and thinking about the dense topics. He is the only one I’ve met to have continued on with ANY online course, and I began to wonder how he could do it. Was it sheer discipline? Willpower? Passion? A combination of these? </p>

										<h2> <center> New Disney Channel Show: Confucius, Dad, and Me </center> </h2>

										<center> <img src="images/Disney_Channel.png"> </center>

										<p> I think Father Confucius smiles from above as I state why my dad could stay so focused: he wasn’t just reading and watching; he was learning.

										<br> <br>

										Don’t call me an idiot and tell me that you must read to learn or that you can learn a lot by watching Discovery Channel just yet. Hold that thought in for a bit.


										<br> <br>

										Learning involves much more than simple reading and comprehension. It’s a process that goes beyond scanning through textbooks and practicing problems; more than that, it’s a method we use to better our understanding of ourselves and the world around us.
										
										<br> <br>

										Learning is a transformative process. It’s a process that isn’t meant to show off to others how cultured we are, nor is it meant to impress that cute girl living next door. Instead, the focus is inward, on our self. We improve morally, intellectually, spiritually, and many other adverbs ending in “-ly.” How? Let me show you. </p>

										<h2> <center> String Theory </center> </h2>

										<p> I recently read an amazing book about how we perceive advantages and disadvantages, and how often times our perception is completely wrong (“David and Goliath”, by Malcolm Gladwell, in case any of you are interested). 

										<br> <br>

										For instance, US primary and secondary schools often brag about having small classes, with the idea that a small class means a more intimate learning environment between students and teachers. 

										<br> <br>

										However, this turns out not to be completely true: having too few students can create an awkward atmosphere, where discussions are lackluster and bland (I’m looking at you, Ms. Turtle). 

										<br> <br>

										On the other end of the spectrum, you have classes with fifty or more students. At that point, the environment is so vast that it’s strange NOT to be intimidated (or at least respect the awkward tension in the room).
										
										<br> <br>

										There’s a balance, a goldilocks point, where there are neither too many nor too few students. Having only five students or up to fifty are both extrema that should be avoided, despite believing the claim that the fewer students to a teacher, the better.

										<br> <br>

										What does this have to do with learning, or string theory for that matter? Well, the Confucian viewpoint believes that learning is not a study of multiple discrete disciplines but a wholesome endeavor: that everything we study is linked together by a single string, guan (Chinese symbol: 貫). 

										<br> <br>

										Yes, the lead up to explaining the title was a pun. Welcome to my website.

										<br> <br>

										What does this string do? It ties up everything we’ve ever truly learned, for what we learn becomes part of our being as a whole. Whether it’s a poem about a melancholic tree swaying it’s dead branches alone at night or finance theory, what we truly learn becomes a part of our very being, and is applied as we live. </p>

										<br>

										<h2> <center> Transformers, Roll Out </center> </h2>

										<p> Learning is a transformative process: we better ourselves by reading, understanding, and integrating the lesson into our lives. In a traditional sense, learning was the method for self-cultivation, and I believe it still has positive effects even today. To truly understand a topic, it’s futile to cram knowledge (not to say this method isn’t effective in preparation for exams, that’s a completely different topic).

										<br> <br>

										Nowadays, it’s very difficult to believe in this because there are some topics that aren’t necessarily the easiest to incorporate (I don’t plan to integrate fiscal policy into my life anytime soon…). That’s where another aspect of learning comes in: intrinsic learning. 

										<br> <br>

										I’ll talk about this later on, but to give you a brief idea of what it is, consider the following quote:

										<blockquote> Learning never exhausts the mind - Leonardo da Vinci </blockquote>
